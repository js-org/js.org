Thanks for creating a pull request to request a new subdomain from JS.ORG

Before creating your pull request, please read and complete the following steps:

- Ensure that your pull request changes only the cnames_active.js file, adding a single new line for your subdomain request
  - Follow the existing format established by the other entries, a new line with the subdomain as the key and the target hostname as the value
  - Add your new line to the file in alphabetical order, and follow the guidance given by the comments in the file itself

- Fill out this pull request template in your pull request description, maintaining the format provided to you
  - Tick the two checkboxes, agreeing to the sentences, below by placing an x inside the square brackets ([ ] becomes [x])
  - Add a link (GitHub repository, Vercel deployment, etc.), so we can review your site
  - Explain what your site content is and how it relates to the JavaScript community/ecosystem, so we can validate your request

- Ensure that your site content follows the content requirements set out in our README: https://github.com/js-org/js.org#content-requirements
  - Notably, make sure that your site is not a personal site, and that it is clearly content that is relevant to the JavaScript community/ecosystem
