<p class="bigger">Are you a JavaScript developer looking for free webspace to host your project?
    <br>Check out
    <a title="GitHub Pages" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub
        Pages</a>. To make things perfect we provide you with a free and sleek URL like one of these:
</p>

<p>
    <em id="typewriter" class="tri">https://<span id="hermes">foo</span>.js.org</em>
</p>

<p> Your page just has to <em>provide some reasonable content with a clear connection to JavaScript!</em>
    Follow these four steps to get your own free JS.ORG subdomain for your GitHub Page:</p>



<section>
    <input id="s1I" name="step" type="radio" checked="checked">
    <article>
        <h3>1</h3>If you haven't already, now it's time to log in to your GitHub account and set up your GitHub Page
        by following
        the instructions
        <a title="GitHub Pages" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"
            href="https://pages.github.com/">here</a>. To get a head start you can simply use the generator with one
        of the provided themes and add some content
        to your new page.
    </article>
    <input id="s2I" name="step" type="radio">
    <article>
        <h3>2</h3>Now you should determine your js.org subdomain: either choose your username or the name of your
        repo according
        to the existing GitHub Pages URL (for http://foo.github.io/bar, either "foo.js.org" or "bar.js.org" would be
        possible). More details in the
        <a title="JS.ORG's Wiki" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/js-org/js.org/wiki">wiki</a>.
    </article>
    <input id="s3I" name="step" type="radio">
    <article>
        <h3>3</h3>Add a file named "CNAME" to your repo (in the "gh-pages" branch for project pages) with a single
        line matching
        the domain you have chosen (e.g. "foo.js.org" without quotes). If you face any problems, check out the
        section

    <input id="s4I" name="step" type="radio">
    <article>
        <h3>4</h3>To finish the procedure, make a pull request in our GitHub
        <a title="JS.ORGs repository" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"
            href="https://github.com/js-org/js.org/tree/master" target="_blank">repository</a> that adds your
        subdomain to the list of existing JS.ORG domains. Your new URL should go live within
        24 hours (keep an eye on your pull request in case of a naming conflict or a question from our side).
