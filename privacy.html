    <p>Stefan Keim</p>
    <h2 id=\ "place_of_processing\">Mode and place of processing the Data</h2>
    <h3>Methods of processing</h3>
    <p>The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized
        destruction of the Data.
        <br />The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and
        modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible
        to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of JS.ORG (administration, sales, marketing, legal,
        system administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting
        providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated
        list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.</p>
    <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
    <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be
            allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely
            on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing
            of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;</li>
        <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations
            thereof;</li>
        <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>
        <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
            vested in the Owner;</li>
        <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular
        whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter
        into a contract. </p>
    <h3>Place</h3>
    <p>The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing
        are located.
        <br />
        <br /> Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a country other than
        their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data, Users can check the section containing
        details about the processing of Personal Data.</p>
    <p>Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the European Union or to
        any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the
        UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.
        <br />
        <br /> If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or
        inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.</p>
    <h3>Retention time</h3>
    <p>Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been collected for.</p>
    <p>Therefore:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner and the User shall
            be retained until such contract has been fully performed.</li>
        <li>Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed
            to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the
            Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent to such processing,
        as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer
        period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.
        <br />
        <br /> Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to
        erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the
        retention period.</p>
    <h2 id=\ "use_collected_data\">The purposes of processing</h2>
    <p> The Data concerning the User is collected to allow the Owner to provide its Services, as well as for the following purposes:
        Traffic optimization and distribution, Displaying content from external platforms and Hosting and backend infrastructure.
        </p>
    <p>Users can find further detailed information about such purposes of processing and about the specific Personal Data used
        for each purpose in the respective sections of this document.</p>
    <h2 id=\ "data_processing_detailed_info\">Detailed information on the processing of Personal Data</h2>
    <p>Personal Data is collected for the following purposes and using the following services:</p>
    <h3>Displaying content from external platforms</h3>
    <p>This type of service allows you to view content hosted on external platforms directly from the pages of JS.ORG and interact
        with them.
        <br/> This type of service might still collect web traffic data for the pages where the service is installed, even when
        Users do not use it.</p>
    <h4>GitHub button and social widgets (GitHub Inc.)</h4>
    <p>The GitHub button and social widgets are services allowing interaction with the GitHub and Gist services provided by
        GitHub, Inc.</p>
    <p> Personal Data collected: Usage Data. </p>
    <p> Place of processing: United States &ndash;
        <a href=\ "https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-policy\" target=\ "_blank\" rel=\ "noopener noreferrer\">Privacy Policy</a>. Privacy Shield participant. </p>
    <h3>Hosting and backend infrastructure</h3>
    <p>This type of service has the purpose of hosting Data and files that enable JS.ORG to run and be distributed as well as
        to provide a ready-made infrastructure to run specific features or parts of JS.ORG. Some of these services work through
        geographically distributed servers, making it difficult to determine the actual location where the Personal Data
        are stored.</p>
    <h4>GitHub Pages (GitHub Inc.)</h4>
    <p>GitHub Pages is a hosting service provided by GitHub, Inc.</p>
    <p> Personal Data collected: various types of Data as specified in the privacy policy of the service. </p>

    <h3>Traffic optimization and distribution</h3>
    <p>This type of service allows JS.ORG to distribute their content using servers located across different countries and to
        optimize their performance.
        <br/> Which Personal Data are processed depends on the characteristics and the way these services are implemented. Their
        function is to filter communications between JS.ORG and the User's browser.
        <br/> Considering the widespread distribution of this system, it is difficult to determine the locations to which the
        contents that may contain Personal Information User are transferred.</p>
    <h4>CloudFlare (Cloudflare)</h4>
    <p>CloudFlare is a traffic optimization and distribution service provided by CloudFlare Inc.
        <br/> The way CloudFlare is integrated means that it filters all the traffic through JS.ORG, i.e., communication between
        JS.ORG and the User's browser, while also allowing analytical data from JS.ORG to be collected.</p>
    <p> Personal Data collected: Cookies and various types of Data as specified in the privacy policy of the service. </p>
