**Claiming a subdomain for your project**

Please read over

instructions on claiming a `js.org` subdomain.

Before creating your pull request please review the following items and ensure
you are in the clear with your request:

- What subdomain should you request:
  [Subdomain Determination](https://github.com/js-org/js.org/wiki/Subdomain-Determination)
- Is your site ready for a `js.org` subdomain:
  [No Content](https://github.com/js-org/js.org/wiki/No-Content)
- Are you happy with the Terms and Conditions of `js.org`:
  [Terms and Conditions](http://js.org/terms.html)

When creating your pull request, ensure that you are merging your forked and
edited `master` branch into the `master` branch of the base `js.org` repository.
Please see the wiki article
